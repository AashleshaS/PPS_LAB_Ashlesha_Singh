# Python Programming Lab ‚Äì Assignments by Ashlesha Singh

Welcome to the Python Programming Lab repository by Ashlesha Singh. This collection encompasses a series of Python programs developed as part of the lab assignments for the [Python Programming Subject (PPS)](https://github.com/AashleshaS/PPS_LAB_Ashlesha_Singh.git). Each script is designed to reinforce fundamental programming concepts and problem-solving skills in Python.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

The repository is organized with individual Python files corresponding to specific assignments. Here's an overview of the available programs:

1. **Area Calculations**
   - `1.Areaofcircle.py`: Calculates the area of a circle given the radius.
   - `2.AreaofRectangle.py`: Computes the area of a rectangle using length and breadth.

2. **Control Structures and Loops**
   - `10.Display the Grade.py`: Determines the grade based on marks input.
   - `11.Check whether date is valid or not.py`: Validates a given date.
   - `12.Factorial of number.py`: Calculates the factorial of a number.
   - `13.Printing Pattern.py`: Prints specific patterns using loops.
   - `14.Combination of Digits.py`: Generates combinations of digits.
   - `15.Multiplication of two matrices.py`: Performs matrix multiplication.
   - `16.Prime Numbers.py`: Checks for prime numbers within a range.
   - `17.Count no. of vowels.py`: Counts the number of vowels in a string.
   - `18. Palindrome checker.py`: Checks if a string is a palindrome.
   - `19.Remove Punctuations.py`: Removes punctuation from a given string.
   - `20.Reverse of a String.py`: Reverses the input string.
   - `21.SumofDigits.py`: Calculates the sum of digits of a number.
   - `22.SumofDigitsusingRECURSION.py`: Recursively calculates the sum of digits.
   - `23.PhoneBookManager.py`: Manages a simple phone book application.
   - `24.FibbonacciNumbers using module.py`: Generates Fibonacci numbers using a module.
   - `25.SumofComplexNumbers.py`: Calculates the sum of complex numbers.
   - `26.Display the car details.py`: Displays details of a car using classes.
